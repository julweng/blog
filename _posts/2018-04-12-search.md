I now am equipped with skills that can help bridge the gap between people and technology.
My code has direct impacts on how users experience the web content. 
Web development updates at such a rapid pace that I would never get bored of learning.

I know that I no longer need to wait for funding to buy pipettes, tips and kits for experiments. 
I no longer have to wait three, four, five years to gather samples. With my laptop and text editor,
I could build something that can enrich people's lives.

Now that I am in the process of job hunting, 
I do understand how people feel about bootcamps and career changers, 
especially one with a PhD in biology trying to cross over to the web development world.
I know without connections, a lot of the times, my CV just disappear.

It has been almost a month. I have received countless rejections, including the times I've tried to cold reach to people on LinkedIn. Sometimes, at meetups, if people know I am looking for a job and I just graduated from a bootcamp, they try to avoid me. 

There have also been recruiters who lost interest in me because of my lack of experience, 
the gap in my career (hello? I was trying to get a green card...), and my mere basic knowledge of Python and SQL. 

I know there are a lot of difficulties ahead of me. First job is always the hardest.
The jobs I feel passionate about, the employers don't want me.
It's kindda like a dating app. I've been swiped left a lot.
But, I will keep at it. I will get to that door one day.
