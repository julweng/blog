In order to work with my students and colleagues, I had to learn a little bit of everything.
I had to learn a bit of SQL, Python, R, etc. 
Basically, a bit of everything, but master of nothing. 

And then, I met my husband, who is a C/C++ software engineer. 
 
In order to impress him, I also began learning C/C++ and gave up pretty quickly.
To be honest, my goal was never learning how to program in C/C++. Besides, I made myself look like an idiot anyway.

Now, I am no genius. Even though I have a PhD in Biology, even though I have always been a persistent, hard working student, generally, when people want to learn everything, they basically end up retaining very little of that knowledge.

Good thing is, because I decided to teach in a CS department, which is a very, very strange path that I believe most of my biology colleagues would agree, and because I made friends from another field, through these friends, I met my husband. 

I thank him, for being incredibly supportive of me throughout my journey.
