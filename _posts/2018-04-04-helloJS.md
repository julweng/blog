I hate C/C++. 
I couldn't understand anything. Linked list, stack, heap. They sounded like a foreign language.
Of course, the lecture materials consisting of excerpts of C/C++ documentation did not help.
I hate to admit that I cheated in that course.
Without my husband's help, I highly doubt I could pass that course.

I found I liked Python because it is more readable, but I didn't know what I could do with the basics that I have learned. 
I tried doing some DNA sequence search and had fun. But, that was pretty much it.

SQL and R were fun, too. R was a joke. I already knew the basics. I was taking that course for credits toward the life sciences information technology certificate.
However, I started using R and SQL for keeping track of our monthly spendings. I know...using these tools for that was kind of an overkill, but I had to do something with what I've learned.

Data mining using WEKA was awful. The instructor pretty much just gave cut-and-paste sections of the WEKA documentation.
I know how to use the tool and interpret the results. However, I still don't understand the algorithms behind mining.

My thoughts: I am a much better teacher :)

Then, I came across the Free Code Camp and it was love at first sight <3
