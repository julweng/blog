Ever since I made a model of the DNA molecule from styrofoam balls for a high school biology project, I've always known I’d like to be a molecular biologist. However, when I was doing my PhD in Canada, I got hit pretty hard by the emergence of Bioinformatics.

It was these papers that I submitted for peer-review and the reviewer comments were along the lines of:

“Have you done this bioinformatics analysis”,<br> 
“You should check your analysis with so and so R package”, <br>
“You should draw a network.”...blah blah blah.<br>

After I got my PhD, I went back to Taiwan, did about a year and a half of post-doc at Academia Sinica, and ended up getting a faculty position at the CS department of a private university. And so the weirdest journey of my life began...
