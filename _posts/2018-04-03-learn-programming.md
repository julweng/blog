I was extremely lost. 

Doing something that makes a difference has always been my career goal. However, it seemed that I am poorly equipped. 
It also didn't make sense to go back to school to learn new lab skills. I already have a PhD in Biology.

Then, I realized, I shouldn't be this passive, waiting for any labs to want to train me.
If I am not meant to have biology in my life, I should embrace something else.
Since I've developed an increased interest in technology, and I have dabbled a bit in programming before, perhaps I should explore this further.

So, I began taking courses and learning different kinds of languages and see which ones I like.
