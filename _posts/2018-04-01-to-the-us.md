So, just when I was thinking of acquiring more trainings, my husband had the chance to relocate to the US.
I decided to quit my job as a professor, move to the US with him, and go back to being a post-doc after six 
years of working in front of a computer instead of a bench.

I was very excited to go back to working in the lab. 

Unfortunately, no one wants to hire someone whose lab skills have gone rusty and whose scope of knowledge of bioinformatics only include usage of tools and no real software development experiences. 

I totally understand. Having been a principal investigator myself, I wouldn't want to invest part of my already very limited budget on someone that I need to train. Especially when it is getting harder and harder to acquire funding for scientific research.  

I couldn't go back to teaching because my teaching experience was not quite transferrable. 

I could always just be a homemaker...but then I would get bored...
