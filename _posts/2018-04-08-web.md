After fiddling around with the cat app on free code camp a couple times, I decided I wanted a more structured system of learning.
And, after much research, I signed up for Thinkful's full-stack flex program. 

The curriculum was all online. However, there was a great amount of support, from the three mentor sessions a week, 
regularly-held Q & A sessions for immediate help on assignments or projects, to workshops and mock interviews. 
Even if no regular mentor suppor was available, there were always other mentors and peers on the Slack channel who were happy to help.
This was a very intensive, humbling yet enpowering learning experience.

In four months, I picked up a new set of skills that can be applied to the front-end and back-end.
I've built three applications, full-stack, testing, and React/Redux. 
I learned data structure and algorithms. 
And...I finally understood linked list.
I was also exposed to the weird parts of JavaScript, which made it all the more interesting.
