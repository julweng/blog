What made me wander away from my path as a biomedical researcher?

Well, there was this one time at a conference, when I was presenting my research results, I was hit with these questions:

"what do these mean for the patients?"
"will these cure their disease?"

Well, of course the answer was "no". The results don't offer solution to the root of the problem. These charts, tables, figures generated by software tools, look fancy, complicated, and intelligent, but they are still quite a distance away from solving the problem. It takes several years, huge amount of resources, and lots of baby steps to acquire a clear understanding of how one gets certain diseases.  

I realized...I have been living in an ivory tower. I sit in front of a computer, read and write papers. I teach kids biology. Sure, I've gained a huge respect for how technologies are improving biology, but I never felt like I was making any direct impact on people's lives. 

I knew I had to do something. Maybe go back to school, obtain more advanced skills, but what should I learn?
